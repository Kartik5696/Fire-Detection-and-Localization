# Fire-Detection-and-Localization
â€¢	Inspired by the great potential of Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we can detect fire from images or videos at an early stage. Considering the fair fire detection accuracy of the CNN model, it can be of assistance to disaster management teams in managing fire disasters on time, thus preventing huge losses.
